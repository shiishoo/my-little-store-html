                <p class="line-5"> Crochetique started when I got really into crocheting. I learned lots 
                    of cool patterns and noticed many people around me liked crocheting too. But there 
                    weren't many stores that sold crochet stuff, so I decided to make one. As I learned 
                    more about crocheting and made lots of things, I saw that there were many others like 
                    me who loved it. I thought it would be great to have a store just for crocheters like 
                    us. So, I worked hard to make Crochetique a place where people could find all they 
                    needed for crocheting and meet others who loved it too. Now, Crochetique is a place 
                    where crocheters can get together, share ideas, and find everything they need to 
                    crochet amazing stuff. It's been a fun journey turning my hobby into a business that 
                    brings joy to others who love crocheting as much as I do.
